## 🛠️ Development

I am currently focusing on **front-end development with React.js**, so I built my portfolio using **React.js and Next.js**. 

Being at a **junior level**, I prioritize **personal projects** and development ideas over work experience. My portfolio is **designed for both full-time employment and freelance work**, ensuring it stands out. 

🔹 **Project Insights**  
The portfolio aims to provide an overview of:

## 🎨 UI/UX & Theming

### 🌗 Theming  
Modern UI trends emphasize **Light & Dark mode**, which I have implemented. **Balancing contrast** between themes ensures accessibility and usability.

### 📑 Project Details  
A well-structured **project detail** section is essential in both **UI/UX portfolios** and **development portfolios**. It explains:
- **Preparation**: Research & planning before starting  
- **Requirements**: Data collection and specifications  
- **Approach**: Strategies to achieve project goals  

International developers, designers, and marketers use **portfolio storytelling** to present their **ideas and problem-solving skills** effectively.

### 🚀 Branding  
**Personal branding** is crucial in competitive fields like **freelancing and social organizations**.  
Even with **high-quality work**, without proper branding, **recognition is limited**. I have integrated **branding strategies** into my portfolio content.

### 📦 Content Management  
For managing **dynamic content** like projects and blogs, a **CMS (Content Management System)** is highly beneficial.  
I used **Sanity.io CMS** to handle content dynamically.

## 📅 Planning & Preparation

### 📖 Portfolio Research  
Although I specialize in **front-end development**, I have made efforts in **UI/UX design**.  
Since I haven't formally studied UI/UX, I learned by:
- Studying **top designers & developers**
- Collecting **inspiration**
- Applying the **“Collect - Imitate - Create”** method  
- Breaking away from imitation to establish my unique **design style**
